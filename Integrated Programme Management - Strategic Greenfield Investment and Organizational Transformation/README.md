## 1. Programme Overview

This project simulates the complete **Programme Management** and planning phase for a strategic expansion initiative by Magnus, aimed at establishing a fully operational, components-producing automotive factory in Gora Padao Haldwani, India, and simultaneously transforming its organizational structure.

The programme demonstrates the ability to define, align, and manage three highly interdependent projects to achieve a unified, high-value organizational transformation.

## 2. Programme Strategic Goals

The overarching objective of this entire programme is to leverage the new Indian facility and organizational changes to achieve substantial financial improvement:

* **Primary Goal:** Enable the new factory to have its own product development capability.
* **Financial Outcome:** Increase the company's **EBITDA profit margin (EBITDA / Sales) from 9% to 14%**.

## 3. The Programme Structure: Three Interdependent Projects

The programme is executed through three distinct but heavily constrained projects, demonstrating complex dependency management.

| Project Name | Primary Scope | Total Cost (Estimate) | Key Dependency / Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project 1: Plant Construction** | Design and erect the physical manufacturing plant for automotive combustion engine components. | **€24.6 Million** | Completion of the Manufacturing Phase is required for Projects 2 & 3 to commence. |
| **Project 2: ERP Implementation** | Implement a centralized ERP system to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and improve data integrity. | **€207,682.00** | Must start after Project 1's manufacturing phase. Testing starts after Project 1's testing phase. |
| **Project 3: Platform** | Organizational shift to a matrix structure; establish a platform/program approach to product management. | **€337,752.28** | Must start after Project 1's manufacturing phase **AND** Project 2's testing phase. |

## 4. Key Quantitative Decisions & Outcomes (Project 1 Detail)

The initial phase required critical decision-making on time-cost trade-offs to de-risk the subsequent projects:

* **Objective:** Optimize the Plant Construction schedule to accelerate the start of the downstream ERP and Organizational projects.
* **Technique Applied:** Detailed **Project Crashing** analysis using Critical Path Method (CPM).
* **Crashing Strategy:** Added specialized resources (Italian Engineers, Indian Worker Teams) to critical tasks in the Engineering and Erection phases.
* **Result:** Reduced the overall schedule duration by **340 days** at an calculated additional cost of **€513,160.00**.

## 5. Programme Management Competencies Demonstrated

This coursework showcases advanced Program Management and strategic planning skills:

* **Strategic Alignment:** Demonstrated how three independent initiatives (Physical Build, IT System, Organizational Change) are necessary and aligned to achieve a single, high-level business outcome (EBITDA increase).
* **Dependency Management:** Created and managed explicit temporal constraints between projects (e.g., Project 2 testing completion enabling Project 3's change phase).
* **Financial Integration:** Defined individual project budgets within the overall programme context (€25M total) and quantified the strategic cost of schedule acceleration (€513K crash cost).
* **Resource Coordination:** Outlined the roles of multiple entities (Magnus Italy, Magnus India, Global Prime Cars, ERP Consultant) and internal teams (Guiding Coalition, Change Team) required for execution across all three projects.
* **Organizational Change:** Defined the change management process for the shift to a matrix organization (Project 3), which involves addressing stakeholder opinions and creating a new corporate vision.

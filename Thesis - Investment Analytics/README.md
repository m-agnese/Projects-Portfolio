## 💡 Executive Summary & Business Question

This thesis investigates the **statistical relationship** between key policy-driven sustainability indicators—the **Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI)** and the proprietary **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Index**—and high-risk, high-reward investment dynamics.

The core focus is an empirical analysis of **Venture Capital (VC) investments in European green energy companies**. The goal is to provide data-driven insights into the drivers of sustainable investment, separating true environmental impact from mere financial fundamentals to inform policy and investment strategy.

## 🔬 Advanced Analytics & Methodology

The study employed a rigorous, multi-faceted analytical approach, demonstrating proficiency in complex statistical and data science techniques:

1.  **Data Engineering & Proprietary Index Creation:**
    * Calculated a **Sovereign ESG Index** using the **Entropy Method** for objective weight assignment.
    * Cleaned and processed large-scale data from the **European Investment Fund database** (European Cleantech Sector).
    * Utilized a **Machine Learning Model** for the imputation and analysis of missing CCPI values.

2.  **Econometric Modeling & Predictive Analytics:**
    * **Logistic Regression:** Used to **predict the probability** of a green energy firm securing VC investment.
    * **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:** Used to quantify the impact on the **total dollar amount** of VC funding received.
    * **Spatial Analysis:** Investigated the geographical distribution and clustering of VC-backed firms.

## 📊 Key Findings & Strategic Impact

The analysis provides actionable strategic insights into how non-financial factors influence capital allocation:

* **Quantifiable Impact of ESG on Capital:** **ESG scores show a significant positive correlation with the *total amount* of VC investment secured.** This confirms that sophisticated investors use ESG factors as a risk/opportunity signal when deploying large sums of capital.
* **Identifying True Drivers over Proxies:** The study found that the **likelihood of securing VC investment** is *not* driven by sustainability scores, but by **stronger economic fundamentals** such as **R&D spending** and **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**. This highlights the ability to use complex modeling to identify the *real* leverage points for attracting venture capital.
* **Geographical Strategy:** Found that while high-ESG countries attract more VC-backed firms, the presence of strong **R&D infrastructure** and favorable operational costs plays a critical, non-linear role in determining firm location patterns.

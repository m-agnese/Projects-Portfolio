# Information Systems Project — System Analysis

This project was developed for the **Information Systems** course at university.  
The objective was to analyze a business process, identify requirements, design system functionalities, and produce complete system documentation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To perform a full system analysis for a proposed information system, including process modeling, functional requirements, user interactions, and estimated implementation costs.

**My Role:**  
I was responsible for:
- BPMN process modeling  
- Use Case diagrams and textual descriptions  
- User-Centered Design (UCD) documentation  
- Interface mockups  
- Class diagram  
- Cost estimation spreadsheet  
- Final documentation report

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

### **`/docs` — System Documentation**
- BPMN model  
- UCD (User Centered Design) document  
- Use Case diagram  
- Use Case descriptions  
- Class diagram  

👉 Access:  
- [BPMN Model](docs/BPMN.pdf)  
- [UCD Document](docs/UCD.pdf)  
- [Use Case Diagram](docs/UC.pdf)  
- [Use Case Table](docs/UCD_table.pdf) *(if available)*  
- [Class Diagram](docs/class.pdf)  

---

### **`/mockups` — Interface Prototypes**
Contains 2–3 mockups designed to visualize key system interfaces:

- [Mockup 1](mockups/mockup1.pdf)  
- [Mockup 2](mockups/mockup2.pdf)  
- [Mockup 3](mockups/mockup3.pdf)  

---

### **`/reports` — Cost & Resources**
- [Cost Estimation Spreadsheet](reports/Project_cost.xlsx)

---

## 🧩 Methods & Tools Used
- **BPMN 2.0** for process modeling  
- **Use Case** and UML documentation  
- **Class Diagrams** for structural modeling  
- **Wireframing / Mockups** for interface design  
- **Excel** for cost analysis  
- **GitHub** for documentation versioning  

---

## 📌 Key Deliverables
- Complete BPMN model  
- User-centered requirements documentation  
- Full functional Use Case set  
- System structure via class diagram  
- Interface prototypes  
- Cost estimation sheet  

---

## 🔍 Summary
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Analyze organizational processes  
- Model systems using BPMN and UML  
- Design user-centered interfaces  
- Estimate project costs  
- Produce clear and well-structured documentation

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Perform calculations for industrial plant operations, design layouts for machines/workstations, balance workloads across machines, and produce plant documentation and layout schematics.

**My Role:**  
- Computations and analysis using **Excel**: plant capacity calculations, balancing workloads, machine utilization  
- Plant layout design using **AutoCAD** for schematics/blueprints/layout drawings  
- Documentation of plant design, computations and analysis results

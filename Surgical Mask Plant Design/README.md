## 1. Project Overview

This project is a complete **feasibility study and detailed industrial plant design** for a new high-volume manufacturing facility dedicated to producing surgical face masks. Given a fixed market demand and machine specifications, the project focused on optimizing the entire production system from raw material arrival to finished product shipment.

The study demonstrates expertise in **plant layout design, material handling, capacity planning, and efficiency assessment** required for modern industrial operations.

## 2. Project Scope and Objectives

The primary objective was to design a production plan capable of meeting the specified market demand while ensuring maximum operational efficiency.

**Key Design Decisions and Requirements:**

* **Capacity Planning:** Determined the optimal number of production machines required based on demand and known machine cycle times.
* **Layout & Flow:** Designed the plant's macro- and micro-layout to minimize movement and maximize throughput.
* **Warehouse Design:** Selected the appropriate type of warehouse (e.g., dedicated, integrated) and defined its size and configuration.
* **Logistics:** Chose suitable internal material handling systems (e.g., forklifts, manual pallet jacks) for raw materials and finished goods.

## 3. Analysis and Methods

The plant design was validated and refined through quantitative and visual methods, showcasing robust analytical skills:

* **Process Analysis:** Determined the exact sequence and time required for all activities, from material preparation to final packaging.
* **Spaghetti Chart Analysis:** Used **Spaghetti Charts** to visually trace material and operator flow across the proposed layout, identifying and eliminating bottlenecks and unnecessary travel distances to optimize the plant's efficiency.
* **Efficiency Assessment:** Calculated and verified the production rate and capacity utilization of the selected machinery.
* **Cost Estimation:** Performed initial budgeting for key infrastructural components:
    * Cost of **loading docks** (e.g., €14,000 for four docks).
    * Cost of industrial doors and security doors (e.g., €55,000 total).
    * Cost of internal handling systems (e.g., manual pallet jacks, forklifts).



## 4. Key Deliverables

All documentation, including the detailed plans and calculations, are included in the final report:

* **Capacity Calculation:** Detailed computation justifying the number of machines and production lines.
* **Macro- and Micro-Layouts:** Visual floor plans showing the placement of machinery, workstations, and storage areas.
* **Material Handling Selection:** Justification for the choice of internal transport equipment.
* **Efficiency Metrics:** Analysis of flow effectiveness (e.g., distance traveled, non-value-added time).

## 5. Skills Demonstrated

This project serves as a strong demonstration of practical Industrial Engineering competencies:

* **Plant Design:** Proficiency in developing efficient, demand-driven industrial layouts and flow optimization.
* **Operations Research:** Quantitative analysis of production rates, capacity, and resource allocation.
* **Logistics & Material Handling:** Strategic selection and placement of warehousing and internal transport systems to minimize operational friction.
* **Process Improvement:** Ability to use tools like the **Spaghetti Chart** to critically assess and improve process efficiency.

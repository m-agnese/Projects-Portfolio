## 1. Project Overview

This repository documents the comprehensive system analysis and design phase for the proposed **Ethical Food Marketplace**—an information system designed to connect local farmers directly with consumers through a managed, ethical purchasing group (EPG) model.

The primary objective was to perform a complete system analysis, including business process modeling, requirements elicitation, structural design, user interaction design, and initial cost estimation. This project demonstrates proficiency in standard modeling languages and full-cycle system documentation.

## 2. The System Under Analysis

The proposed system is a complex, multi-role platform that facilitates transparent and ethical transactions. The design phase focused on three distinct user groups:

| User Role | Core Functionality Designed | Skills Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer** | Secure shopping, product filtering by ethical criteria, order placement, and order tracking. | User-Centric Design (UCD) |
| **Farmer/Producer** | Product listing management, inventory updates, and order fulfillment tracking via a dedicated dashboard. | Process Modeling (BPMN) |
| **Employee/Admin** | System management, user approval (onboarding farmers), order oversight, and site configuration. | System Architecture & Management |

## 3. Project Scope and Deliverables

This project focused exclusively on the **analysis, modeling, and documentation** phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

**My Role:** As the sole system analyst, I was responsible for the end-to-end documentation and design, including:

* **Process Modeling:** Development of the full **BPMN** 2.0 process model.
* **Requirements Elicitation:** Creation of Use Case diagrams and textual specifications.
* **Structural Design:** Detailed **UML Class Diagram** for the system's database and object structure.
* **User Interface Design:** Production of interface mockups based on **User-Centered Design (UCD)** principles.
* **Resource Planning:** Comprehensive cost estimation and resource allocation spreadsheet.

## 4. Methodologies & Tools Used

This project relied on industry-standard techniques to produce verifiable and precise documentation:

* **Process Modeling:** **BPMN 2.0** for visually mapping the 'as-is' and 'to-be' business processes.
* **Structural Modeling:** **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**, specifically **Use Case** and **Class Diagrams**.
* **Interface Design:** **User-Centered Design (UCD)** principles combined with wireframing/mockup tools.
* **Resource Management:** **Microsoft Excel** (or equivalent) for detailed cost analysis and resource estimation.
* **Version Control:** **GitHub** for managing documentation versions and providing structured access.

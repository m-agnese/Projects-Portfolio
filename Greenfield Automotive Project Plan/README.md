## 1. Programme Overview

This project simulates the complete **Programme Management** and planning phase for a strategic expansion initiative by Magnus. The goal is to establish a fully operational automotive components factory in Gora Padao Haldwani, India, and simultaneously execute a critical organizational transformation.

The programme demonstrates the ability to define, align, and manage three highly interdependent projects to achieve a unified, high-value outcome: the complete re-engineering of the organizational structure and a new manufacturing capability.

## 2. Programme Strategic Goals

The overarching objective of this integrated programme is to leverage the new facility and organizational changes to achieve substantial financial and operational improvement:

* **Financial Outcome:** Increase the company's **EBITDA profit margin (EBITDA / Sales) from 9% to 14%**.
* **Operational Outcome:** Enable the new factory to have its own product development capability, leading to lowered production costs.

## 3. The Programme Structure: Three Interdependent Projects

The programme is executed through three distinct but heavily constrained projects, demonstrating complex **dependency management** and scheduling.

| Project Name | Primary Scope | Total Cost (Estimate) | Key Dependency / Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project 1: Plant Construction** | Design and erect the physical manufacturing plant for automotive combustion engine components. | **€24.6 Million** | The Manufacturing Phase must be complete before Projects 2 & 3 can start. |
| **Project 2: ERP Implementation** | Implement a centralized ERP system to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and improve data reliability. | **€207,682.00** | Must start after Project 1's manufacturing phase. Testing starts only after Project 1's testing phase. |
| **Project 3: Platform** | Organizational shift to a matrix structure; establish a platform/program approach to product management. | **€337,752.28** | Must start after Project 1's manufacturing phase **AND** Project 2's ERP testing phase completion. |

## 4. Project Details and Key Outcomes

### **Project 1: Plant Construction (Focus on Schedule Control)**
* **Scope:** Planning the full lifecycle including Engineering, Purchasing (machinery like Single Spindle Machine, Gantry Loader), Logistics (€143,000.00), Site Erection, and Final Testing.
* **Technique Applied:** Detailed **Project Crashing** analysis using Critical Path Method (CPM).
* **Outcome:** Reduced the overall schedule duration by **340 days** at an calculated additional cost of **€513,160.00**, accelerating the start of downstream IT and Organizational projects.

### **Project 2: ERP Implementation (Focus on IT Integration)**
* **Scope:** Implementation of a centralized ERP platform by integrating various departments and functions to eliminate data duplication.
* **Resources:** Managed a joint team including **Magnus Italy**, **Magnus India**, and an external **ERP consultant** team (Project Director, ERP Experts, Business Analysts).
* **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced operational costs through process optimization, enhanced services with shorter response times, and greater reliability of corporate data.

### **Project 3: Platform (Focus on Organizational Change)**
* **Scope:** A transformative shift from a traditional functional structure to a **matrix organization** to improve accountability and application development effectiveness.
* **Change Management:** Defined a change process involving multiple leadership tiers—a **Guiding Coalition** (Sponsor, Senior Guiding Team, Field Guiding Team, Change Team)—to create urgency and a new corporate vision.
* **Constraint:** The 'Enable action by removing barriers' phase is directly dependent on the completion of the ERP implementation (Project 2).

## 5. Skills Demonstrated

This programme demonstrates expertise in critical competencies necessary for large-scale, international strategic initiatives:

* **Programme Governance & Alignment:** Successfully defined and structured three interdependent projects to deliver a unified, high-level business goal (EBITDA increase).
* **Quantitative Project Control:** Expert use of the **Critical Path Method (CPM)**, schedule crashing, and quantitative time-cost trade-off analysis.
* **Risk & Dependency Management:** Identified and managed complex temporal and resource dependencies across manufacturing, IT, and organizational streams.
* **Stakeholder Management:** Outlined coordination and resource involvement across multiple entities: **Magnus Italy**, **Magnus India**, **Global Prime Cars** (Partner/Owner), and **External Consultants**.
* **Organizational Change Management:** Defined the structure and process for driving a fundamental shift in the corporate operating model.
